What I am trying to do with the bridge pup is to have the volume pp-pot be an on-off (7-sound mod). There is an additional on-off-on toggle switch for reversing hot and ground (out of phase?). The phase switch should be in effect any time the bridge is active, whether from the 5-way or the vol-pp.
I have the bridge pup wired to the opposite side of the 5-way to prevent the phase switch from grounding out the whole guitar.
The tone pot is two cap mod but with greasebucket.



I think I found a bug in my design. Can someone please check my thinking on this, with the diagram as it is now I think that if the 5 way is set to bridge and the Bridge On PP is set to off, then the phase reverse switch should work as expected. BUT if the Bridge On PP is activated, and the phase reverse switch is set to reverse, the combination will act as a kill switch.Does this sound correct?


The 5-way won't work with this set up if I want to use the tone pot...

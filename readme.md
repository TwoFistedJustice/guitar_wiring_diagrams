## About

These are the wiring diagrams I have created for guitars I have worked on, mostly my own, but also some I have given to friends.

# The Creator

I do not say that I "play guitar". I am very clear that I "persist at guitar". I also really enjoy setting them up and creating new (to me at least)
circuit desings for them.

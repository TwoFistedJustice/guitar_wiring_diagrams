6/5/22 Volume doesn't seem to work
Removed pot and disassembled it because I coulnd't get it to work. I think I fried the center lug.
Replaced it with a temporary volume pot and now it works.

7/16 Tone doesn't work....

7/20 - Tone pot fixed. Bad ground.


Tone Pot: 
Switch between grease buckets

Volume pot
Switch is bridge on/off

The third switch was meant to be phase reverse but there isn't room in the cavity.


Still to do:


8/28
The volume wasn't working with the push pull, probably just a bad ground. I pulled it.

Replaced with a normal audio pot using a Guitar Family treble bleed.

I also added a 20nf cap the "tone off" circuit because the tone-off feature was kind of BORRRRRRRRRING.

## About

These are the wiring diagrams I have created for guitars I have worked on, mostly my own, but also some I have given to friends.

# The Creator

I do not say that I "play guitar". I am very clear that I "persist at guitar". I also really enjoy setting them up and creating new (to me at least)
circuit designs for them.



# How to view
The ability to make and share these these diagrams would not exist if it were not for the hard work and dedication of [bancika](https://github.com/bancika) and his free
guitar circuit design software [DIY Layout Creator](https://bancika.github.io/diy-layout-creator/). If you are interested in music creation or working on the circuitry of
guitars, amps, pedals, and whatnot check out his awesome blog [DIY Fever](http://diy-fever.com/software/diylc/)
